Project Repo for code and analysis accompanying Johnston et al. 2019 in the special issue of _Environmental Biology of Fishes_ ("Informing California Fish Management Using Biotelemetry").

Steps of the analysis:

## Munging
1. Read in raw data - group receivers at gated locations and discard simultaneous detections.
2. Screen for orphan detections (no tags detected before release, and all detections can be traced to a receiver deployment)
3. Discard false detections (identified in the VUE FDA screen)
4. Identify shed tags/mortalities
5. Categorize exit status for each individual

## Statistical analysis
